/* The main purpose of the Battery class is to keep track of how much charge is currently in the battery.
 * We do this using the "Coulomb Counting" technique, which is discussed widely on the internet.
 * The algorithm is simple: measure the current flowing into or out of the battery, and measure how much time
 * the current has been flowing. From this, we can deduce the amount of charge that has gone into,
 * or out of the battery. Over time, the accuracy decreases due to cumulative roundoff error, as well
 * as inaccuracies in the time and current measurements. We minimize this loss of accuracy by detecting
 * each time the battery becomes fully charged, because at that point we know exactly how much charge
 * is in the battery. 
 *
 * Our charger uses the "constant-current constant-voltage" method to charge the battery. When the charger
 * is first connected to the battery, the charger provides a voltage that is slightly higher than the 
 * battery's, which causes current to start flowing into the battery. The charger keeps increasing the 
 * voltage until the current reaches the allowed maximum (for our system, this appears to be around 2.6 amperes).
 * As the battery fills with charge, the charger keeps changing the voltage as needed to keep the current constant.
 * When it reaches a certain maximum voltage, the charger stops increasing the voltage. The current continues
 * to flow, but gradually reduces as the battery reaches full charge.
 * At that point, the current drops to 0 and we're done.
 *
 * You can see measurements of voltage and charge flow in the following documents:
 * https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14-mchRN22HC6OSyAcN329NEcRRjF2_VMbKz3yHDDEoI
 * https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fPnn2ukakk8MpyGW_KrOW2ediHh8FU6yWr4Kfq2UNJs
 * 
 * The PCB provides information about battery and charger on 4 input pins:
 * BATTERY_VOLTAGE_PIN - a 10-bit ADC that gives voltage. If no charger is connected, this is 
 *                       the battery's voltage. If a charger is connected, then the charger and battery are
 *                       effectively wired together so this is the voltage of both.
 * CHARGE_CURRENT_PIN - a 10-bit ADC that gives the charge flowing into or out of the battery. This value
 *                      must be combined with the REFERENCE_VOLTAGE_PIN reading to get a proper result. 
 *                      When no charger is connected, charge will be flowing out of the battery. When a
 *                      a charger is connected, charge will typically be flowing into the battery, however
 *                      if the battery is full and the system is consuming a lot of power, then the battery
 *                      and the charger will share the load and so you might see that charge is flowing out.
 * REFERENCE_VOLTAGE_PIN - a 10-bit ADC. Readings from this ADC must be combined with CHARGE CURRENT readings.
 * CHARGER_CONNECTED_PIN - a 1-bit digital input that says whether or not a charger is connected.
